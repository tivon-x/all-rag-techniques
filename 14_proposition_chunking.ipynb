        "在这个笔记本中，我实现了命题分块——这是一种高级技术，用于将文档分解为原子级的事实陈述，以实现更准确的检索。与传统的按字符计数简单分割文本的分块方式不同，命题分块保留了各个事实的语义完整性。\n",
        "\n",
        "命题分块通过以下方式实现更精确的检索：\n",
        "\n",
        "1. 将内容分解为原子性、事实性、自包含性和简洁性的事实\n",
        "2. 创建更小、更细粒度的检索单元\n",
        "3. 实现查询与相关内容之间的更精确匹配\n",
        "4. 过滤掉低质量或不完整的命题\n",

        "1. **命题生成：**使用LLM将文档块分解为事实性的、自包含的命题。\n",

        "命题分块方法的动机是构建一个系统，将文本文件分解为简洁、事实性的命题，以便进行更细粒度和更精确的信息检索。使用命题可以实现更精细的控制，并更好地处理特定查询，尤其是在从详细或复杂的文本中提取知识时。比较使用较小的命题分块和较大的文档分块，旨在评估细粒度信息检索的有效性。\n",
        "\n",
        "好处：\n",
        "- **细粒度性：**通过将文档分解为小的事实性命题，系统能够实现高度具体的检索，从而更容易从大型或复杂的文档中提取精确答案。  \n",
        "- **质量保证：** 使用质量检查的大语言模型确保生成的命题符合特定标准，从而提高检索信息的可靠性。  \n",
        "- **检索灵活性：** 对比基于命题的检索和基于较大块的检索，可以评估在搜索结果中细粒度与更广泛上下文之间的权衡。"
